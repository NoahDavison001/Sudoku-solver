Sudoku Solver

Runs in terminal window, allows user to generate and solve a random sudoku puzzle, input their own puzzle to solve, or test the average solve speed of the program.

For modes 1 and 2, outputs board state after each code iteration and highlights board updates.
  Also gives final readout, including solved puzzle, number of iterations, and time taken to load/solve the puzzle.
For mode 3, only outputs a final readout for the average time and load time. 

Includes time-out if number of iterations exceeds 30, for performance reasons.
